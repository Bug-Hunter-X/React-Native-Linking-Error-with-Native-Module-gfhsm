# React Native Linking Error with Native Module

This repository demonstrates a common React Native error involving the failure to properly link a native module from a third-party library. The app crashes on startup or when attempting to use functions from the affected library.

## Problem

The issue stems from an incomplete or erroneous linking of native code within the React Native environment. This might be due to:

*   Incorrect installation procedure for the third-party library.

*   Issues within the third-party library's linking mechanisms.

## Solution

This repository provides a solution involving verifying the linking steps and utilizing the correct methods for your chosen library.  The solution may also encompass verifying correct installation of build tools and native dependencies.
